#+TITLE: gRPC-Web with ClojureScript

This should have been easy...but ran into problems.  Most of this is likely my ignorance of how the javascript
world shifted while I was looking at other things.

1. We will design a quick little protocol for a client to get a stream of events.
2. We will generate the javascript for the protocol.
3. We will use that from clojurescript.

* Protocol

#+begin_src 

#+end_src 

* Step 2: Build the gRPC communication code

* Step 3: Use the communication code from CLJS

* Problem: Why can't we find grpc.web.MethodDescriptor
